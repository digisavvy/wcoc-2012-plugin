A Plugin to Manage WordPress Admin

This is a functionality plugin I made for my presentation at WordCamp Orange County 2012

===== Session Description =====

As WordPress developers/designers, we are tasked with providing a solution that clients can easily use and update on their own.

There’s a fine line with regard to the access one gives their clients. A WordPress site is like a Toyota, or a Honda. Low maintenance and easy to run. If the keys are given to the client, a lot of damage can be done and countless hours troubleshooting, wasted money and more.

Clients don’t want to be treated like children, and as a developer we want our clients to be happy with the solution provided.
